2. Sales by Region: bar chart comparing performance across regions
3. Sales by Category: pie chart showing share of each product category
4. Profit by Sub-Category: red for loss, green for profit
5. Top 5 Customers: ranked table by total sales
6. Monthly Sales Trend: line chart showing how sales moved over time
